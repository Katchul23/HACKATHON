## Phrase -1
- **Texte** : For the moderate-intensity orienteering group,

the exercise intensity
range was calculated as 40â€“50% of HRR, and 80â€“85% of HRR was used for the vigorous-

inten
sity orienteering and vigorous-intensity exercise groups
- **Raison du rejet** : Classification incertaine

## Phrase -1
- **Texte** : Then, to simulate the intervention,

the orienteering
groups located the first three checkpoints at a light walking pace of 30â€“40%

of HRR with the
help of a researcher
- **Raison du rejet** : Classification incertaine

## Phrase -1
- **Texte** : Those in the orienteering groups navi
gated to the checkpoints using the map at either a moderate (40â€“50% of HRR)

or vigorous
intensity (80â€“85% of HRR) along any route they chose
- **Raison du rejet** : Classification incertaine

## Phrase -1
- **Texte** : In contrast,

those in the exercise only group exercised
at a vigorous intensity (80â€“85% of HRR) but did not engage in orienteering
- **Raison du rejet** : Classification incertaine

## Phrase -1
- **Texte** : For the Mnemonic Similarity
Task,

three cases were removed as the difference in the percent corrected and raw score for
appropriate key use was >8% (moderate orienteering = 2, vigorous orienteering = 1)
- **Raison du rejet** : Classification incertaine

## Phrase -1
- **Texte** : For blood lactate,

a Kruskal


Wallis Means Ranks Test was used to confirm that the proportions of those above or below the
lactate threshold of 4mmol/L differed by group,

thus indicating that our intervention was ade
quate in reaching the desired exercise intensity
- **Raison du rejet** : Classification incertaine

## Phrase -1
- **Texte** : HRMax for the moderate-intensity group and 80â€“85% of HRMax for the vigorous-

intensity
groups
- **Raison du rejet** : Classification incertaine

## Phrase -1
- **Texte** : These potential sex-based differences in lactate-

induced BDNF activation may
be at play with our predominately female sample (65%)

and should be followed up in future
Despite our participantsâ€™

familiarity with the campus on which the orienteering course was
set,

both the moderate and vigorous intensity orienteering groups travelled significantly far
ther and, by extension, made more errors than the most efficient route
- **Raison du rejet** : Classification incertaine
